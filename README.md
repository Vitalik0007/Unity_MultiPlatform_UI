# Unity_MultiPlatform_UI

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a multi-platform user interface built in Unity with support for keyboard, mouse, and gamepads (Sony DualSense, Xbox Wireless Controller). The application features several interactive screens that users can freely navigate between:

- **Title Screen** — the initial screen displaying a prompt to press a button to proceed to the menu.
- **Main Menu** — the main screen for selecting actions.
- **Load/Save** — a screen for managing saved games.
- **Settings** — a tabbed settings screen with various UI elements: buttons, sliders, checkboxes, and more.
- **Credits** — a screen showing information about the developers.

The interface adapts in real-time to the connected input device, updating button prompts and navigation logic accordingly for gamepads or PC controls.
